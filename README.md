## Introduction 
In this project, we'll create a system for checking for security issues using OpenVas in Microsoft Azure. We'll also set up a vulnerable Windows 10 computer with old software to test it.
## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to conduct two types of scans on a vulnerable virtual machine, one without authentication and one with credentials, and to understand how to fix any vulnerabilities that are discovered.
## Technologies and Software Employed:
- OpenVas
- Windows 10 Pro Virtual Machine
- VNet
- Old Version of Adobe Reader: 10.0_AdbeRdr1000_en_US_1
- Old Version of VLC Player: vlc-1.1.7-win32
- Old Version of FireFox: Firefox Setup 97.0b5
## Configure to allow Credentialed Scans

Disable Windows Firewall

## Redmediation
OpenVas provided a very detailed description and recommended solution for each vulnerability.  I remediated some vulnerabilities according to the suggested solutions.

After deepdiving into various more vulnerabilities and following the solutions being offered for each of them I Once again ran another scan to observe the differenece.

## Verification
I performed another credentialed to verify the vulnerabilities has been resolved after implemented solutions.  There is a downward trend icon indicating that there are less vulnerabilities compared to the first credentialed scan.

## Conclusion
In this lab, I established a secure Azure network with an OpenVas Vulnerability Management Scanner VM, conducted scans with and without credentials using OpenVas, and effectively remediated the vulnerabilities that were identified.
